# 🎥 YouTube Clone  

Hey there! 👋  

Welcome to my **YouTube Clone** project! This is something I built just using **HTML** and **CSS** to recreate the look of YouTube. It’s simple, clean, and a fun way for me to practice web design. Hope you like it! 😄

## ✨ What’s Inside  

- **Video Gallery Layout**: A grid-based layout to showcase video thumbnails—just like YouTube.  
- **Responsive Design**: Works smoothly on both desktops and mobiles.  
- **Simple Styling**: No over-the-top effects, just a straightforward and user-friendly design.

## 🛠️ How I Built It  

Honestly, this project is as straightforward as it gets:  
- **HTML**: To structure everything.  
- **CSS**: To make it look nice and work on all screen sizes.
